Introduction

This is a final project in DIGITAL SYSTEM course at University of Toronto, Electrical and Computer Engineering. We coded as a 2-person team to implement a circuit programs that based on FPGA and verilog and we chose to implement a mobile game, called “ Step Black ” onto the display of VGA by applying the FPGA and Verilog methods. The user utilizes four specific keys on PS/2 keyboard to hit the
“black bricks” displayed on the VGA screen and avoid “white bricks” simultaneously in order to win the game in shorter time.
